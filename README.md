# EcommerceApp
Added Cart Status Component, now it updates and shows quantity of items in cart and the subtotal, as the user clicks on "Add to cart" button either from the category view or from product details view.

We can't see the items in cart yet, as there's no UI component for that.
This issue will be fixed in the upcoming commit, as well as performing CRUD operations with items in cart.
